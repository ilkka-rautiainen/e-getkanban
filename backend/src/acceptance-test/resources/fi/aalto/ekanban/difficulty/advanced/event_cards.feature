Feature: Event cards
  As a game player
  I want to receive different cards of event cards
  So that the gameplay rules are changed in order to simulate a more realistic kanban project situation

  @ignore
  Scenario: Event card X: given game & when a turn is played -> event card comes -> check the affect
  @ignore
  Scenario: Event card Y: given game & when a turn is played -> event card comes -> check the affect
  @ignore
  Scenario: Event card Z: given game & when a turn is played -> event card comes -> check the affect
  # TODO: add scenarios for all different types of event cards
